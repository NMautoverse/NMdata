## 0.0.2
This release contains bugfixes and experimental support for merging nonmem input and output data without a row identifier. 

A clearer cut has been made between the pmxtricks package (version 0.0.10) and NMdata. The packages should not overlap in exported functionality, and they do not depend on each other.
