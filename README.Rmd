##  A fast R package for efficient data preparation, consistency-checking and post-processing in PK/PD modeling
Pharmacometrics and PK/PD modeling offers unique information for
decision-making in several steps of drug development. However, the leg work in pharmacometrics remains technical, and this is a typical bottleneck for a pharmacometrician to contributing even more.

The NMdata objective: *Automate the book
keeping and allow more time for actual modeling*
Preparing data sets - and if you use Nonmem, reading the results data - can be tedious, and mistakes can lead to hours of
frustration. NMdata provides useful tools (including automated
checks) for these trivial tasks. 

*Any functionality in
the NMdata can be used independently of the rest of the package*, and
NMdata is not intended to force you to change any habits or
preferences. Instead, NMdata tries to fit in with how you (or your
colleague who worked on the project before you) do things.

The best place to browse information about the package is
[here](https://philipdelff.github.io/NMdata/). The quickest way in is
probably the
[Cheatsheet](https://philipdelff.github.io/NMdata/articles/NMdata-cheat.html). All
documentation is of course included in the package itself too.

<!-- https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/philipdelff/NMdata/blob/master/devel/NMdata-cheat.html -->

## Prepare, check, and export PK/PD data 
On the data-generation side, functionality is provided for
documentation of the datasets while generating them. Check out [this
vignette](https://philipdelff.github.io/NMdata/articles/DataPrepare.html)
on the topic. There are functions for automatic checks of (some) data
merges, handling and counting of exclusions flags, final preparations
for ensuring readability in NONMEM, and ensuring traceability of
datasets back to data generation scripts. 

## Check data as read by NONMEM
Finally, the `NMcheckData`
function will do an extensive and fully automated set of checks of the
data before you run NONMEM. And did NONMEM not behave? `NMcheckData`
can debug the data _as seen by NONMEM_. That's right - it has never
been easier to find data bugs.

## Automated and general reader of Nonmem results data
Reading the resulting data from Nonmem can require a few
manual steps. Especially because all modelers seem to do things a
little differently. `NMscanData` can return all data output (`$TABLE`) from Nonmem combined, and if wanted with additional columns and rows in
input data. It's as simple as
```{r,NMscanData-example1}
res <- NMscanData("xgxr014.lst",recover.rows=TRUE)
```
And we are ready to plot (a subset of) the result:
```{r,NMscanData-example1-plot}
res.plot <- subset(res,ID%in%c(113,135)&EVID==0)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(res.plot,aes(TIME))+
    geom_point(aes(y=DV,colour=flag))+
    geom_line(aes(y=PRED))+
    facet_wrap(~trtact)+
    labs(y="Concentration (unit)",subtitle=unique(res.plot$model),colour="Observations",
         caption="NOTICE:\nObservations are coloured by a character column fetched from input data.\nSamples below LLOQ are rows added from input data.\nPlots are correctly sorted because factor levels of dose are preserved from input data.")+
    theme_bw()+theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

Want a tibble instead? Easy:
```{r,NMscanData-example2}
res.tibble <- NMscanData("xgxr001.lst",as.fun=tibble::as_tibble,quiet=TRUE)
```
Or a data.table? This time, we'll configure NMdata to return data.tables by default:
```{r,NMscanData-example3}
NMdataConf(as.fun="data.table")
res.dt <- NMscanData("xgxr001.lst",quiet=TRUE)
```

NMscanData is very general, and should work with all kinds of models,
and all kinds of other software and configurations. Take a look at
[this
vignette](https://philipdelff.github.io/NMdata/articles/NMscanData.html)
for more info on the Nonmem data reader. Then you will learn how to
access the meta data that will allow you to trace every step that was
taken combining the data and the many checks that were done along the
way too.


## How to install
`NMdata` is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/), and [MPN](https://mpn.metworx.com). To install from the package archive you are already using, do:

```
install.packages("NMdata")
library(NMdata)
```

If your archive has not been updated since July 2021, you may not find
`NMdata` that way. In that case you have two other options. You can
explicitly select CRAN for the installation. Or if you should want a
version that has not yet reached CRAN, installing from Github is easy
too.

```
## Option 2: Install explicitly from CRAN
install.packages("NMdata",repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
library(NMdata)

## Option 3: Install from github
library(remotes)
install_github("philipdelff/NMdata")
library(NMdata)
```
If you use the Github version, you may want to see the
[FAQ](https://philipdelff.github.io/NMdata/articles/NMdata-FAQ.html)
for how to install specific releases from Github (ensuring reproducibility).
