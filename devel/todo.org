* NMdata todo
** Design
*** DONE For a version 0.2.0, omit the extra variability levels
    CLOSED: [2020-06-23 Tue 20:51]
just provide functions to get them
*** DONE Allow for say input.txt/output.txt
    CLOSED: [2020-06-29 Mon 21:28]
**** NMtransInput
*** DONE Support for return as tibble or whatever
    CLOSED: [2020-12-23 Wed 11:21]
Could we use an option, NMdata.return="dplyr::as.tibble" which could then be
reached and applied from within NMdata? It would have to not create extra
dependencies. This solution is being tested on pmxtricks.
*** DONE Where does NMcode2R belong?
    CLOSED: [2020-12-23 Wed 11:21]
It is needed in NMdata but should it be exported from NMdata?
Conclusion: export from pmxtricks, internal in NMdata.
*** DONE Check assign by ref inside package
    CLOSED: [2021-04-02 Fri 11:18]
 copyOrNot <- function(data){
     data[,newcol:=1]

1: 1      1
*** TODO [#B] messageWrap internal/external
    The mentioning of where a message comes from is only useful if a
    function is called from other functions. Possible to distinguish
    somehow?
** New functions
*** DONE NMcheckColNames
    CLOSED: [2021-06-10 Thu 20:20]
**** return input column names and Nonmem interpretation for user to spot errors
**** Bad name, what could we call it?
*** TODO [#B] NMfreezeModels
    Remember to add chmod and describe that only a flat dir structure is supported so far
*** DONE NMtransInp
    CLOSED: [2021-05-20 Thu 11:29]
    Translate column names according to Nonmem. Take the code from
    NMscanInput.
*** DONE function to replace file name extension - fnExtension

*** TODO [#B] A function to check data - NMcheckData
**** TODO Find previously used code
**** TODO Implement checks in pmxtricks todo
**** TODO Implement more checks
https://doi.org/10.1208/s12248-012-9387-9
**** Additional checks
***** TODO Having NA in FLAG is dangerous
      It makes it unclear how the filter will work
***** TODO AMT>0 for EVID=0 is not allowed (I believe)
*** TODO [#B] A function that defines NULL variables
    Risk now is that arguments are set to NULL
    Export to parent. Not sure check allows though...
** Function improvements
*** NMextractDataFile
**** DONE Add support for windows absolute paths
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 16:11]
     I don't think this was ever an issue. The regular expression used
     should match both unix and windows absolute paths.
*** NMwriteSection
**** DONE Support for multiple sections
     CLOSED: [2021-04-05 Mon 12:06]
Instead of the section argument, NMreplacepart must accept newlines as a named
list.
*** compareCols
**** DONE rows are not being sorted correctly.
     CLOSED: [2021-04-18 Sun 14:38]
     Seems not to prioritize columns that only exist in one of the
     data.tables.
**** DONE Bug for diff.only=FALSE
     CLOSED: [2021-04-18 Sun 12:16]
*** NMextractText
**** TODO reduce lines and text to one argument
The information is sufficient when taking into account the linesep
arguement. If length(lines) and linesep is given, a warning must be
issued. Once done, NMgetSection must be updated as well.
*** NMscanInput
**** TODO argument char.comment.inp
     User may write say # (input_data_debug.csv) in front of column
     names in csv and then use IGNORE=# to avoid them in Nonmem. We
     should support the same arg to remove the char from the input
     column name. However, only relevant if column names are not
     translated.
**** DONE Get number of subjects as before filtering
     CLOSED: [2021-06-08 Tue 18:54]
Challenge is that the filters are applied before the cplumn names are
changed. So we need access to the old data and know what column to
look at - called col.id after the translations.
**** Pseudonyms A=B
***** TODO [#C] A=B pseudonym labels should be matched against reserved variable names
***** DONE copy data to have acces using both names
      CLOSED: [2021-05-17 Mon 22:51]
****** Edit these lines in NMscanInput
       ## For now, we just take the first name used in A=B labeling. 
       nms <- sub(".*=(.*)","\\1",nms)
***** DONE Names of variables must be taken from lst, not mod
      CLOSED: [2020-06-06 Sat 23:43]
 mod should only be used for path to dataset.
***** DONE Add support for absolute paths
      CLOSED: [2020-06-09 Tue 23:22]
***** DONE SKIP like DROP
      CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:36]
***** TODO TIME and related columns
 I still don't really understand the documentation on this, but it doesnt seem
 too hard to implement. It should NOT only be interpreted when the A=B format is used in
 $INPUT. If something is called TIME, it must be checked for format.
***** DONE .mod files should be accepted as the file argument
      CLOSED: [2020-09-17 Thu 15:19]
      Maybe file can be missing/NULL if file.mod is given.
*** NMtransFilters
**** TODO [#A] Report translation in NMmeta
**** DONE Replace single = with ==
     CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:05]
According to the manual single = can be used for comparisons. This is not and
should not be translated by NMcode2R.
**** DONE $INPT is an alias for $INPUT
     CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:09]
**** TODO [#B] Implement NULL
The way to change the missing string in nonmem. User could use
NULL=NAN which would mean that NA should be interpreted as NA in R.
**** TODO [#B] Implement or at least detect RECORDS
A way to limit rows read into nonmem
*** NMtransInput
**** TODO [#B] Add comparison column input-nonmem
***** if input!=nonmem,
***** nonmem %in% all(input)
***** tolower(nonmem)==tolower(input) OK
***** diff
***** off
*** NMscanTables
**** TODO [#A] include meta data as NMinfo
**** DONE Lastonly does the same as firstonly
     CLOSED: [2020-07-13 Mon 19:37]
*** NMscanData
**** DONE nmout and model must not overwrite existing
     CLOSED: [2021-06-15 Tue 11:49]
     The can still overwrite, but a warning is thrown
**** DONE Check that no new values of col.row are found in output
     CLOSED: [2021-06-12 Sat 00:13]
**** DONE Test for disjoint ID's
     CLOSED: [2021-06-12 Sat 00:13]
     If ID's are disjoint, it's actually really easy to make a new ID
     and use that for merging firstonly. But only if a row identifier
     is used. If not the same new ID is to be added to the
     firstonly. This will need testing.
**** DONE Move time checks up
     CLOSED: [2021-05-22 Sat 00:18]
Now, if number of rows don't match in input and output, the user don't
get warnings about time. This is bad because updates to input data is
a likely reason.
**** DONE Add support for merge.by.row="ifAvailable"
     CLOSED: [2021-05-20 Thu 11:29]
**** DONE Make sure all options in NMdataConf are documented
     CLOSED: [2021-05-22 Sat 00:18]
**** DONE input file name in meta columns
     CLOSED: [2021-05-15 Sat 21:05]
***** table column should be called file
**** DONE intro translate.input argument
     CLOSED: [2021-04-18 Sun 11:22]
**** DONE method.combine to merge.by.row
     CLOSED: [2021-04-04 Sun 23:17]
     Since we only have and will only have two methods, this should be
     a binary switch between the methods.
**** DONE Check if col.row is being modified in Nonmem.
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 15:39]
**** TODO [#B] check overview.tables
Either they must be firstonly, or they must be full.length.
**** TODO [#B] Limitation: tables with EXCLUDE_BY
**** DONE Limitation: FIRSTLASTONLY
     CLOSED: [2020-07-13 Mon 19:37]
**** DONE Implement recoverRows using mergeByFilters
     CLOSED: [2020-06-23 Tue 20:52]
**** TODO [#B] Add support for col.row of length>1
**** DONE Consistent behaviour when missing data arguments
     CLOSED: [2020-09-17 Thu 16:03]
***** use.input (default)
****** Means that output data will be merged onto input data
****** If input data is missing or merge not possible, give warning
****** if only firstonly data available, do the merge if possible
***** mergeByFilters (defult in future?)
***** Only allowed if use.input=TRUE
***** Means that we will translate NM filters and cbind rather than using a row identifier.
***** If the filters go wrong, give error
***** Firstonly (FO) data can only be used if ID is both input and FO table
  We can implement taking the sequence of IDs from input and restore
  ID's from that
**** DONE Improve summary of what tables were used and how.
     CLOSED: [2021-02-23 Tue 22:24]
Right now it only says if input or output. Table name would be helpful.
**** TODO [#B] Support for no ID, no ROW in firstonly tables
If mergeByFilters we can take the sequence of ID in the input
data. But what if an ID comes back? I think a record is in FIRSTONLY
whenever ID changes, but test this.
**** TODO [#C] Check if ID has been corrupted by output format
check if variables are consistent within ROW: ID (others?) This is
fatal and will happen when using long ID's and non-matching format
when writing tables from Nonmem.
**** TODO [#B] New argument to define columns to read from input data
ID should be default. Maybe TIME too?
**** DONE Run NMorderColumns in the end
     CLOSED: [2020-12-23 Wed 11:29]
Remember to use what we know about col.row. 
**** DONE source for nmout and model must be internal
     CLOSED: [2020-07-18 Sat 23:13]
in var table 
**** TODO [#B] report tables that are not used
See xgxr013.lst in test_NMscanData. A firstonly table cannot be included. This
is not visible in summary because summary is based on tables in returned
data. It should be based on tables in meta$tables.
*** NMwriteData
**** TODO [#B] Include a randomly generated ID in meta data that we can check files against?
**** DONE Add support for custom fwrite arguments
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 21:01]
**** DONE When writing a CSV, write meta data to separate file
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 17:53]
**** DONE Support for pseudonyms
     CLOSED: [2021-04-21 Wed 23:16]
     It's called nm.rename. You can only add A in A=B.
**** DONE Check if character variables contain commas
     CLOSED: [2020-09-19 Sat 09:52]
This will cause trouble when writing csv
**** DONE Use fwrite rather than write.csv
     CLOSED: [2021-04-02 Fri 11:33]
**** TODO [#B] Improve support for custom IGNORE/ACCEPT statements
Support for both ignore and accept? A list?
**** DONE Returned text should be a list of sections.
     CLOSED: [2021-04-18 Sun 14:39]
Ultimately, NMreplacePart must accept this as argument.
**** DONE The Nonmem instructions should not include character variables
     CLOSED: [2020-09-17 Thu 22:13]
**** DONE Include an argument to do =DROP
     CLOSED: [2020-09-19 Sat 09:27]
This will only affect the instructions to pass into Nonmem. If =DROP
is on a character variable, subsequent numerics can still be used in
Nonmem.
**** DONE print out dropped variables? 
     CLOSED: [2020-09-19 Sat 09:27]
Not warning. Warning if standard variable?
*** NMordercolumns
**** DONE Don't warn about missing SS, ADDL, II
     CLOSED: [2021-04-11 Sun 12:08]
**** DONE Polish
     CLOSED: [2020-12-23 Wed 11:31]
*** flagsAssign
**** DONE Improve messages at each FLAG coding
     CLOSED: [2020-12-23 Wed 11:31]
**** DONE Make sure we arrange back to original order
**** DONE Introduce a way to apply to a subset only
     CLOSED: [2021-04-05 Mon 09:42]
     - State "DELEGATED"  from "CANCELED"   [2021-04-21 Wed 16:46]
     - State "CANCELED"   from "DELEGATED"  [2021-04-21 Wed 16:46]
     - State "DELEGATED"  from "DONE"       [2021-04-21 Wed 16:46]
This could be EVID==0 or maybe one study in a meta analysis

It's fairly easy to implement. Paste in front of the expression.use column.
*** flagsCount
**** DONE OK respect decreasing or increasing order.flags
**** DONE add .cum of N and Nobs
     CLOSED: [2021-04-26 Mon 10:01]
**** DONE add argument to name "all available data" in table. 
**** DONE Add check on EVID - who wants to mix these?
**** TODO [#B] allow skipping and disabling flags.
***** For this we will need additional two columns - Nobs.matched and N.(entirely.)matched
**** TODO [#B] The function could paste an explained overview to the terminal
**** DONE Add save argument to align with other functions
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 16:17]
*** NMdataConf
**** DONE test that function evaluation does not depend on global env
     CLOSED: [2021-06-15 Tue 13:57]

     CLOSED: [2021-04-02 Fri 11:34]
This is two steps. 
***** A method.merge argument must be introduced in NMscanData
***** col.row can be non-NULL even if using cbind for combining data
**** DONE order.columns
     CLOSED: [2021-04-02 Fri 11:35]
*** stampObj
**** CANCELED Include output filename in stamp
     CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 21:02]
This belong in write functions. stampObj does support extra
arguments. NMdata calls this "writtenTo".
*** summary.NMdata

***** DONE Combine first two tables
      CLOSED: [2021-05-20 Thu 23:22]

** Nonmem examples
*** DONE Use FLAG
    CLOSED: [2020-06-29 Mon 21:28]
rerun xmgr001.mod with IGNORE=(FLAG.NE.0) That would be a nice example
for the vignette.
*** DONE Update all runs with updated data file
    CLOSED: [2020-07-02 Thu 09:28]
** Discussion
*** recoverRows can mean mix of variable interpretations
If recoverRows and a variable is changing interpretation from input to
output, the resulting table will carry two distinct variables
depending on nmout TRUE or FALSE.
