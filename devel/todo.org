* NMdata todo
** Design 
*** TODO For a version 0.2.0, omit the extra variability levels
just provide functions to get them
** Function improvements
*** NMextractText
**** TODO reduce lines and text to one argument
The information is sufficient when taking into account the linesep
arguement. If length(lines) and linesep is given, a warning must be
issued.
*** NMtransInput
**** TODO Names of variables must be taken from lst, not mod
mod should only be used for path to dataset.
