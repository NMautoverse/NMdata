* NMdata todo
** Design
*** DONE For a version 0.2.0, omit the extra variability levels
    CLOSED: [2020-06-23 Tue 20:51]
just provide functions to get them
*** DONE Allow for say input.txt/output.txt
    CLOSED: [2020-06-29 Mon 21:28]
**** NMtransInput
*** TODO Support for return as tibble or whatever
Could we use an option, NMdata.return="dplyr::as.tibble" which could then be
reached and applied from within NMdata? It would have to not create extra
dependencies.
*** TODO Where does NMcode2R belong?
It is needed in NMdata but should it be exported from NMdata?
** New functions
*** TODO summary.NMdata
** Function improvements
*** NMextractText
**** TODO reduce lines and text to one argument
The information is sufficient when taking into account the linesep
arguement. If length(lines) and linesep is given, a warning must be
issued.
*** NMtransInput
**** DONE Names of variables must be taken from lst, not mod
     CLOSED: [2020-06-06 Sat 23:43]
mod should only be used for path to dataset.
**** DONE Add support for absolute paths
     CLOSED: [2020-06-09 Tue 23:22]
**** DONE SKIP like DROP
     CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:36]
**** TODO TIME and related columns
I still don't really understand the documentation on this, but it doesnt seem
too hard to implement. It should NOT only be interpreted when the A=B format is used in
$INPUT. If something is called TIME, it must be checked for format.
**** TODO .mod files should be accepted as the file argument. 
Maybe file can be missing/NULL if file.mod is given. 
*** NMtransFilters
**** DONE Replace single = with ==
     CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:05]
According to the manual single = can be used for comparisons. This is not and
should not be translated by NMcode2R.
**** DONE $INPT is an alias for $INPUT
     CLOSED: [2020-06-15 Mon 21:09]
*** NMscanTables
**** TODO Lastonly does the same as firstonly
*** NMscanData
**** TODO check overview.tables 
Either they must be firstonly, or they must be full.length.
**** TODO Limitation: tables with EXCLUDE_BY
**** TODO Limitation: FIRSTLASTONLY
**** DONE Implement recoverRows using mergeByFilters
     CLOSED: [2020-06-23 Tue 20:52]
**** TODO Add support for col.row of length>1
**** TODO Consistent behaviour when missing data fields
***** use.input (default)
****** Means that output data will be merged onto input data
****** If input data is missing or merge not possible, give warning
****** if only firstonly data available, do the merge if possible
***** mergeByFilters (defult in future?)
***** Only allowed if use.input=TRUE
***** Means that we will translate NM filters and cbind rather than using a row identifier.
***** If the filters go wrong, give error
***** Firstonly (FO) data can only be used if ID is both input and FO table
  We can implement taking the sequence of IDs from input and restore
  ID's from that
**** TODO Improve summary of what tables were used and how.
Right now it only says if input or output. Table name would be helpful.
**** TODO Support for no ID, no ROW in firstonly tables
If mergeByFilters we can take the sequence of ID in the input
data. But what if an ID comes back? I think a record is in FIRSTONLY
whenever ID changes, but test this.
**** TODO source for nmout and model must be internal
in var table 
*** NMwriteData
**** TODO Check if character variables contain commas. This will cause trouble when writing csv.
** Nonmem examples
*** DONE Use FLAG
    CLOSED: [2020-06-29 Mon 21:28]
rerun xmgr001.mod with IGNORE=(FLAG.NE.0) That would be a nice example
for the vignette.
*** DONE Update all runs with updated data file
    CLOSED: [2020-07-02 Thu 09:28]
** Discussion
*** recoverRows can mean mix of variable interpretations
If recoverRows and a variable is changing interpretation from input to
output, the resulting table will carry two distinct variables
depending on nmout TRUE or FALSE.
